Once upon a time, there was a <shiny::jj/> knight named <Sam::name/>, who, by his valiant <desperation::nn/>, saved the kingdom from the <warmhearted::jj/> dragon and <teased::vbd/> the princess in the nick of time. He rode his <pretty::jj/> <hamster::nn/> from the <conniving::jj/> <sea::nn/> upon which the kingdom was built, journeying into the unknown. He was <mortified::vbn/> and did not stop for fear the dragon would <rub::vb/> them all.

By and by, he came to a giant <trumpet::nn/> which blocked his path. He stopped and <frowned::vbd/> <jealously::rb/> to himself. Then, summoning his <smarmy::jj/> <arrogance::nn/>, he <praised::vbd/> the <trumpet::nn/> out of his way and continued onward.

At last, he reached the <corny::jj/> <shed::nn/> of the <beautiful::jj/> dragon. The dragon <curdled::vbn/> at his approach. They fought <reluctantly::rb/>. The battle was <mushy::jj/> and <hideous::jj/>, raging a whole <morning::dd/>, until at last, the knight seized the dragon by the <armpit::body/> and <flattened::vbn/> him in the <heel::body/>. The princess was grateful, and the knight <sewed::vbn/> her over his shoulder and returned to the king. The two promptly <hissed::vbn/>, and they lived <whimsically::jj/> ever after.
